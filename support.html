        <li><h2>What is the waterproof rating? Can I ride in rainy conditions?</h2></li>
        <li>We do not recommend riding in rainy conditions as the wet surface may cause slippage. The product has an IPX-3 waterproof rating, which means it is not designed to be submerged in water. Water damage may lead to short circuits and product damage.</li>
        <li><h2>Can the battery be easily removed?</h2></li>
        <li>No, the battery is built-in and cannot be quickly detached. It requires unscrewing the front wheel and battery box to disassemble the battery, which is not designed for rapid removal.</li>
        <li><h2>What shoe sizes are available? Are they one size fits all?</h2></li>
        <li>The shoes are one size fits all, suitable for US sizes 5-14 (male) and 6-14 (female).</li>

        <li><h2>Can I glide without electric power?</h2></li>
        <li>Yes, you can manually glide like regular rollerblades or roller skates even when the power is depleted.</li>
        <li><h2>Is it difficult to learn how to use these e-skates?</h2></li>
        <li>If you have previous rollerblading experience, you can generally learn within 15 minutes. However, if you are a beginner with limited balance, we recommend patience and practice after making a purchase. For more guide videos please check the AIRTRICK YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOPhrz2P0iewMxRphttp4uQ</li>
        <li><h2>Does it have a suspension system?</h2></li>
        <li>The product primarily relies on the elasticity of the front and rear wheels for shock absorption. Both wheels are made of elastic PU material, with strong shock absorption.</li>
        <li><h2>Is it shipped by sea or air?</h2></li>
        <li>During the checkout process, you can choose between sea and air shipping based on your preferences and requirements.</li>
        <li><h2>How long does it take to ship after purchase?</h2></li>
        <li>Generally, we ship within 1-2 business day after the purchase is made.</li>
        <li><h2>How do I control the speed of the e-skates? What is the slowest speed?</h2></li>
        <li>The speed is controlled by the handheld remote controller. The remote has a throttle, pushing it forward accelerates, and pulling it backward applies brakes. The remote offers four speed modes: LO (up to 3mph / 5km/h), MI (up to 6.2mph / 10km/h), HI (up to 12mph / 20km/h), and PRO (up to 17mph/28km/h). The throttle is gradual, allowing for smooth acceleration from a standstill.</li>
        <li><h2>How do I brake?</h2></li>
        <li>AIRTRICK e-skates are equipped with dual braking systems: electronic brakes on the remote controller and rubber stoppers at the heel part.</li>
        <li><h2>How do I power on and off the AIRTRICK e-skates?</h2></li>
        <li>To power on, simply slide the rear wheel to activate with two audible beeps. The e-skates will automatically power off after 3 minutes of inactivity. There is a small switch button located near the charging port, which requires a small tool to press. A single click powers on the e-skates, and another click powers them off. Generally, this button is not frequently used in regular operation.</li>
